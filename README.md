# Learning OpenTelemetry with Dynatrace
A hands-on guide to learn how to use OpenTelemetry for various scenarios and observe with Dynatrace

## Pre-reqs
Python ( I recommend Python 3.12+ )

Dynatrace Cluster

## Structure
This repository is structured into beginner, intermediate, and advanced examples.

Beginner will focus on fundamental concepts of telemetry, the core signals, and how to send data to Dynatrace

Intermediate will focus on scaling OpenTelemetry with the Dynatrace Collector, to receive, process, and export signals in a near-production setup

Advanced will focus on specific use cases like serverless compute, how developers instrument their own library, and more niche use-cases in general

## Good to know
Before diving in, I would **recommend** getting familiar with the following Dynatrace and OpenTelemetry topics. This repository will expand on all of these topics so reading **isn't** required

### Dynatrace Topics
[Unified Services](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/shortlink/unified-service)

[Ways to export data to Dynatrace](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/shortlink/otel-getstarted)

### OpenTelemetry Topics
[Signals](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/) (baggage is an advanced concept, we will revisit this later if you don't want to read it now)

[Instrumentation Methods](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/instrumentation/)
